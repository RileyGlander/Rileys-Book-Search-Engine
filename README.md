## Description
I decided to build a book search engine so I could create a place to search up books easily and effectivley. This search engines allows the user to create an account and log into it to view their saved books and to add onto them. This project allows the user to switch sections as needed. It contains a section to search for books, see your books, and login/logout. During this module I was able to work with mern to get a better understanding how Mutations and Queries work. 

## Installation
You can install this with git bash by typing in 'git clone Replace this with link' to wherever you want the repository to be installed on your computer. You will want to install the packages so make sure to head to the root of the directory, open it in the Integrated terminal and type `npm i`

## Usage
Download the repository using the instructions provided above. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code. You will want to Right-click at the root of the directory and select 'Open in Integrated Terminal.' In the terminal, type `npm run develop` to start the application and view the page.

## Issues
- On render I get an error of "sh: 1: concurrently: Permission denied"
- When starting up the server with `npm run watch` the error "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec."
