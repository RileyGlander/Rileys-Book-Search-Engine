# Book Search Engine Starter Code

## Description
I decided to build a book search engine so I could create a place to search up books easily and effectivley. This search engines allows the user to create an accoung and log in later to view their saved books and to add on to them. This project uses a navigation tab to be switch sections such as search for books, see your books and login/logout. During this module I was able to work with mern to get a better understanding how Mutations and Qeuries work.
